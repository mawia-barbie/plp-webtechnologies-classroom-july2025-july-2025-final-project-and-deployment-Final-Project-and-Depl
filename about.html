    <p class="about-intro">
      I'm a passionate developer who bridges the gap between beautiful design and robust security.
      With expertise in both creating and protecting digital experiences, I bring a unique perspective
      to every project.
    </p>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        My journey in tech started with a curiosity about how things work and a desire to make them work better.
        What began as tinkering with websites evolved into a deep passion for both creating beautiful digital
        experiences and ensuring they're secure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I specialize in <span class="highlight">full-stack web development</span> and 
        <span class="highlight">cybersecurity</span>, with particular expertise in ethical hacking and
        penetration testing. This unique combination allows me to build applications that are not only
        user-friendly and visually appealing but also secure by design.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not coding or testing security systems, you'll find me exploring the latest tech trends,
        contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.
